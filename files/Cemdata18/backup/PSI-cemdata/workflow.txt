1. prepare the substance records - copy from b4_cemdata18_2021_rdc2 
(these were solids and other cemdata substances + PSI14 aqueous + hydrated)
2. Mester species
PO4-3
AlO2- - hydr --> Al(OH)4-
Ca+2
Cl-
CO3-2
FeO2- - hydr --> Fe(OH)4-
H2O
H+
K+
Na+
Mg+2
NO3-
SiO2@ - hydr --> Si(OH)4(aq)
SO4-2
Sr+2
O2(g)

(generated tables of maters species using aql query)

3. Set V = 0, Cp, S as in PSI2020, for missing Cp -> 0 this is wat gems uses for ---
remove TPMethods, and H, recalculate H from G and S using the record calculator

corrected sourcetdb for Si(OH)4(aq) from PSI, removed Fe(OH)3(am) and (mic) and siderite

4. Generate reaction and save - the V of reaction should be = to the V of dependent component

5. Export to GEMS3

6. Fix keys - PSI_ to psi, H2O@ to H2O(l), O2 to O2(g)
 
7. in GESM recalculate records and chnge d to r where necessary.
