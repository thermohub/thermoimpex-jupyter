test_cr_b database contains new generated reactions.

test_thermochimie 8 was previously use to calculate properties. 

H2O used to calculate the dep comp properties G0 was -237.183 kJ/mol not -237.14 as in PSI2020 becuase the EOS was used
when calculating properties of water.

Reactions were generated using the corrected water and files exported to GEMS format. Phase was taken from old database (were
all data was as DComp)

"all props." 

add "w" to the code of additional aq species, careful not to also add to solids

add W to H2O in sit phase "apsi"
