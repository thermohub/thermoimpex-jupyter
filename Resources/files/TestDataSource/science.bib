abstract = "Abstract In a high-level radioactive waste (HLW) repository, pH has an impact on the solubility, migration, and adsorption of radionuclides. Thus, understanding the effects of pH on the diffusion of radionuclides is essential for long-term disposal of HLW. In this work, the diffusion behaviors of Re(VII) and Se(IV) in compacted Gaomiaozi (GMZ) bentonite at different pH have been investigated by a through-diffusion method. The effective diffusion coefficient, i.e., De values of Re(VII) and Se(IV) were in the range of (1.0–2.4) × 10−11 m2/s at pH 3.0–10.0 and (0.38–2.3) × 10−11 m2/s at pH 3.0–9.0. In the case of Re(VII), the De values remained almost unchanged probably because ReO4− was the dominant species in the pH range of 3.0–10.0. In the case of Se(IV), whose predominant species were HSeO3− at pH &lt; 9.0 and SeO32− at pH ≥ 9.0, the De values decreased by a factor of 3–6 at pH 9.0, i.e., De (pH &lt; 9.0)/De (pH 9.0) ≈ 3–6, implying that the species with a higher valence state had a stronger anion exclusion effect. The decrease in De values can be explained by the diffusion species of Se(IV). Additionally, the rock capacity factor α decreased with the increase of pH. HSeO3− was absorbed on \{GMZ\} bentonite with distribution coefficient Kd values in the range of (1.0–2.5) × 10−4 m3/kg at pH ≤ 8.0, whereas SeO32− was negligibly sorbed at pH &gt; 8.0. "

abstract = "Abstract Sulphate reduction is a key reaction to remove acidity from water bodies affected by acid mine drainage. In this study, 35SSO42− reduction rates determined in sediments from a variety of acidic lignite pit lakes have been compiled. The rates decreased with pH and are strongly dependent on carbon substrate. The rates were fitted to a Monod model adapted to the specific conditions of acidic pit lakes (APL) sediments: i) sulphate reduction rate is independent from sulphate concentration due to the high concentration typically observed in \{APL\} systems (10–30 mM), ii) the observed pH dependency of sulphate reduction was accounted for by an inhibition function Finihibt which considers the occurrence of low cell numbers of sulphate reducing bacteria at pH values &lt; 4.75. Simulated steady-state sulphate reduction rates are predicting measured rates at carbon substrate concentrations of &lt;10 μM. Estimated steady-state reaction time scales range between 2.4 h at pH 7 and 41 h at pH 3 at a carbon half-saturation constant of KC−S = 100 μM and are increasing with increasing KC−S values. Time scales at low pH are too long to allow for significant generation of alkalinity during the time of residence of groundwater passing through the top and hence most reactive zone of \{APL\} sediments which has important implications for the remediation of acidic pit lakes.

abstract = "Abstract Dispersed alkaline substrates (DAS) have been successfully used in passive treatment of highly contaminated acid mine drainage (AMD) to limit coating and clogging issues. However, further optimization of \{DAS\} systems is still needed, especially for their long-term efficiency during the treatment of ferriferous AMD. In the present study, three types of \{DAS\} comprised of natural alkaline materials (wood ash, calcite, dolomite), in different proportions (20%v/v, 50%v/v, 80%v/v), and a substrate with high surface area (wood chips) were tested in 9 batch reactors. The testing was carried out, in duplicate, for a period of 91 days, to evaluate the comparative performance of the mixtures for iron pre-treatment in ferriferous \{AMD\} (2500 mg/L Fe, at pH 4). Results showed increasing of pH (between 4.15 and 7.12), regardless of the proportion of alkaline materials in the \{DAS\} mixtures. Among the tested mixtures, wood ash type \{DAS\} were more effective for Fe removal (99.9%) than calcite or dolomite type \{DAS\} (up to 66%). All tested \{DAS\} had limited efficiency for sulfate removal and an additional treatment unit, such as a sulfate-reducing biochemical reactor, is needed. Moreover, due to the similar performances of the calcite and dolomite DAS, they could be potentially substituted and rather be used in a polishing treatment unit. Based on these findings, the most promising mixture was the 50% wood ash type \{DAS\} (WA50-DAS). "
