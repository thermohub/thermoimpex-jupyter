AB  - Tracer experiments with [super:13]C-labelled diatoms _Thalassiosira rotula_ (Bacillariophycea, 98% [super:13]C-labelled) were conducted at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) in the NE Atlantic (BENGAL Station; 48°50'N, 16°30'W, 4850 m depth) during May/June 2000. _In situ_ enrichment experiments were carried out using deep-sea benthic chamber landers: within the chambers a spring bloom was simulated and the fate of this food-pulse within the abyssal macrobenthic community was followed. In focus was the role of different macrofauna taxa and their vertical distribution within the sediment column in consuming and reworking the freshly deposited material. _T. rotula_ is one of the most abundant pelagic diatoms in the NE Atlantic and therefore 0.2 g of freeze dried _T. rotula_, equivalent to 1 g algal C m[super:-2] yr[super:-1], was injected into each incubation chamber. Three different incubation times of 2.5, 8 and 23 d were chosen in order to follow the uptake of [super:13]C-labelled phytodetritus by macrofauna. After only 2.5 d, 77% of all macrofauna organisms showed tracer uptake. After 23 d the highest degree of enrichment was measured and 95% of the individuals had taken up [super:13]C from the introduced algal material. In addition to that a downward transport of organic matter was observed, even though the mixing was not very intense. The initial processing of carbon was dominated by polychaetes that made up a percentage of 52% of total macrofauna. In general macrofauna organisms that lived close to the sediment surface had higher access to the simulated food-pulse, confirming the hypothesis that individuals close to the sediment surface have the strongest impact on the decomposition of phytodetritus. In our study we observed only modest vertical entrainment of [super:13]C tracers into the sediment. With regard to contradictory results from former [super:13]C-enrichment experiments in bathyal regions, compared to results from our study site in the abyssal plain, we thus propose pronounced differences in feeding strategies between macrofauna communities from continental margins and abyssal plains.

AB  - The unique Antarctic marine environment, its evolutionary history, its biotic peculiarities and its (hitherto) comparatively low degree of human impact make a biodiversity approach and a comparison with other areas particularly worth while. Current knowledge seems to indicate that there is no common pattern for species richness in the various Antarctic subsystems (e.g. pelagic/benthic, shallow/deep) or for different taxonomic groups. Some assemblages appear to be fairly rich in species, others consist of only a few, and the same pattern applies to the various taxa at a higher taxonomic level. The Antarctic marine ecosystem as a whole seems to have a lower percentage of species known to date in most higher taxa than would be expected from its share of the area of the world's oceans. However, comparison with other marine ecosystems is difficult because of differences in area, environment, sampling and processing, and taxonomic knowledge. Comparison with the Arctic Ocean indicates that species numbers of most groups are much higher in Antarctic waters, but many more comparable data are needed to judge whether this also holds generally true for diversity, and whether large-scale latitudinal gradients exist for more than a few groups. Few authors have calculated diversity and evenness indices, and these, too, are often of very limited comparability. High species numbers do not necessarily imply high values of diversity and evenness.

AB  - In August 2000 high concentrations of the dominant herbivorous copepod _Calanus hyperboreus_ were detected in the Arctic Fram Strait, west of Spitsbergen, 1 m above the seafloor at 2,290 m water depth. Individuals from that layer were sampled by a hyper-benthic net attached to the frame of an epi-benthic sledge. For comparison, the vertical distribution of _C. hyperboreus_ in the water column was studied simultaneously by a multiple opening/closing net haul from 2,250 m depth to the surface. Maximum abundance was found close to the surface with 6.6 and 10.0 ind. m[super:-3] at 0-50 m and 50-100 m depth, respectively. However, the major fraction of the population (>40%) occurred between 1,000 and 1,500 m depth. In the deepest layer (2,000-2,250 m) abundance measured 2.2 ind. m[super:-3] and was twice as high as between 100 and 1,000 m depth. In comparison to individuals from surface waters, copepods from the hyper-benthic layer were torpid and did not react to mechanical stimuli. Stage CV copepodids and females from the deep sample contained 4-10% less lipid and showed significantly reduced respiration rates of 0.24 and 0.26 ml O[sub:2] h[super:-1] g[super:-1] dry mass (DM) as compared to surface samples (0.49 and 0.43 ml O[sub:2] h[super:-1] g[super:-1] DM). All these observations indicate that the hyper-benthic part of the population had already started a dormant overwintering phase at great depth. Based on the lipid deposits and energy demands, the potential maximum duration of the non-feeding dormant phase was estimated at 76-110 days for females and at 98-137 days for CV copepodids, depending on what indispensable minimum lipid content was assumed. In any case, the estimated times could not meet the necessary requirements for a starvation period of >6 months until the next phytoplankton bloom in the following spring. The ecological implications of these results are discussed with respect to the life cycle and eco-physiological adaptations of _C. hyperboreus_ to its high-Arctic habitat.

AB  - Various abiotic and biotic parameters, including phytoplankton distribution, were studied to investigate seasonal changes within the fast-ice cover in Chupa Inlet, a freshwater-influenced Arctic-like fjord in Kandalaksha Bay (White Sea). Sea ice and under-ice water were collected along transects in the inlet in February and April 2002. Ice-texture analysis, salinity and [delta][super:18]O values indicated that the complete ice sheet had transformed within 2 months. This resulted from an upward growth of snow ice and subsequent melting at the underside of the ice, which makes a comparison between the two sampling periods difficult in terms of defining temporal developments within the ice. Nutrients, DOC and DON concentrations in the under-ice water were typical for Russian Arctic rivers. Concentrations of nitrate, silicate and DOC in the ice were lower, which is attributed to a loss as the ice forms. The concentrations were also modified by biological activity. In February, there was a strong correspondence between the distribution of biological parameters, including particulate and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (POC and PON, DOC and DON) and inorganic nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate and silicate), which was not the case in April. The correlation between both DOC and DON with ammonium indicates heterotrophic activity within the winter ice collected in February. Sea-ice organisms were distributed throughout the ice, and several assemblages were found in surface layers of the ice. In April, a more typical distribution of biomass in the ice was measured, with low values in the upper part and high algal concentrations in the lower sections of the ice, characteristic of a spring ice-algal bloom. In contrast to the February sampling, there was evidence that the ice-algal assemblage in April was nitrogen-limited, with total inorganic nitrogen concentrations being <1 µ mand a mean inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus ratio of 2.8. The ice assemblages were dominated by diatoms (in particular, _Nitzschia_ spp.). There were temporal shifts in the assemblage composition: in February, diatoms accounted for 40% and in April for >98% of all organisms counted.

AB  - Springtime UV-B levels have been increasing in Antarctic marine ecosystems since the 1970s. Effects on natural phytoplankton and sea-ice algal communities, however, remain unresolved. At the Marginal Ice Edge Zone, enhanced springtime UV-B levels coincide with a shallow, stratified water column and a major phytoplankton bloom. In these areas it is possible that phytoplankton growth and survival is adversely impacted by enhanced UV-B. In coastal areas, however, the sea ice, which attenuates most of the UV-B before it reaches the water column, remains until December/January, by which time UV-B levels have returned to long-term seasonal averages. Phytoplankton from these areas are unlikely to show long-term changes resulting from the hole in the ozone layer. Fjords of the Vestfold Hills, eastern Antarctica, have anoxic basins which contain high-resolution, unbioturbated sedimentary sequences. Diatom assemblages from these sequences reflect the diatom component of the phytoplankton and sea-ice algal assemblages at the time of deposition. Twenty-year records from these sequences show no consistent record of change in species composition, diversity or species richness. Six-hundred-year records from the same area also show changes in species abundance greater than those seen in the last 20 years. From these records it can be seen that recent changes in diatom abundances generally fall within the limits of natural variability and there is little evidence of recent changes that might be associated with UV-B-induced change.

AB  - A laboratory sea ice microcosm was developed to enable the cultivation of the ice diatom _Fragilariopsis cylindrus_ in the skeletal layer and bottom 10 cm of sea ice. Growth of diatoms was ensured by continuous flow of new medium beneath the ice. Light was provided from above by a metal halide lamp to simulate a typical natural daylight irradiance spectrum. Oxygen micro-optodes were deployed in the microcosm to measure micro-profiles through the ice water interface and between the ice lamellae of the skeletal layer. Net oxygen production at the ice water interface, at an irradiance of 40 µmol photons m[super:-2] s[super:-1] and -1.9 °C, ranged between 0.0064 and 0.0225 nmol O[sub:2] cm[super:-2] s[super:-1]. Algal biomass increased from 0.03 µg chlorophyll _a_ (chl _a_) l[super:-1] in the column interior to 42 µg chl a l[super:-1] within 5 mm of the ice water interface. Oxygen micro-profiles revealed diffusive boundary layers (DBLs) which varied between ca. 460 and 1000 µm. DBLs were detected between ice lamellae, the periphery of the ice water interface and extending from the water below the ice through the ice water interface into the spaces between ice lamellae. An additional small-scale horizontal variability of DBLs was also reflected in the net photosynthetic activity. The small-scale patchiness of algae and the differences in DBL thickness were caused by physico-chemical processes (e.g. turbulence, water flow velocity), which in turn were influenced by ice lamellar structure at the ice water interface. These factors were the grounds for the observed variability in net-photosynthesis.

AB  - With the aims of investigating the response of the smallest benthic biota to a strong ice-edge-related input of phytodetritus, and of registering supposed lateral transportation processes of phytodetrital matter with northerly direction under the ice, we analysed a number of abiotic and biotic parameters in surface sediments from the northern Fram Strait. Two transects of 14 stations in total were made. One transect, crossing the Fram Strait from the east to the west, followed mainly the ice edge. The second transect extended latitudinally in a northerly direction, starting in ice-free areas, passing the ice edge, and ending in heavy ice-covered areas, approximately 100 nm north of the ice edge. Stations along this transect were sampled at almost constant water depths to avoid depth-related influences in our investigations. Results showed the expected high phytodetritus concentrations in the ice-edge vicinity. Concentrations of sediment-bound plant pigments were approximately 5 times higher than in ice-covered areas, indicating a very strong phytodetritus input. With increasing distance from the highly productive areas at the ice edge, we found significantly decreasing concentrations of phytodetrital input to the seafloor in a northerly direction. Within the foraminiferans, generic diversity was clearly reduced in the area of strong phytodetritus deposition. Along the latitudinal transect, out of the direct ice-edge influence, foraminiferal diversities slowly increased within increasing distance from the ice edge. The integration of results from earlier foraminiferal investigations, from stations further to the north, indicates a once more decreasing diversity with continually decreasing food supply.

AB  - Sea ice, which covers up to 7% of the planet's surface, is a major component of the world's oceans, partly driving ocean circulation and global climate patterns. It provides a habitat for a rich diversity of marine organisms, and is a valuable source of information in studies of global climate change and the evolution of present day life forms. Increasingly, sea ice is being used as a proxy for extraterrestrial ice covered systems._Sea Ice_ provides a comprehensive review of our current available knowledge of polar pack ice, the study of which is severely constrained by the logistic difficulties of working in such harsh and remote regions of the earth. The book's editors, Drs Thomas and Dieckmann have drawn together an impressive group of international contributing authors, providing a well-edited and integrated volume, which will stand for many years as the standard work on the subject. Contents of the book include details of the growth, microstructure and properties of sea ice, large-scale variations in thickness and characteristics, its primary production, micro-and macrobiology, sea ice as a habitat for birds and mammals, sea ice biogeochemistry, particulate flux, and the distribution and significance of palaeo sea ice.

The samples were collected on four stations with the different distance from the shore (depth 2-10 m). The number of littoral species decreased and the number of ice planktonic species increased with distance from the shore. The abundance of ice algae was maximal (about 1x10[super:6] cells/l) in April, with the greatest value on the station located far from the shore. The abundance of algae at the upper layer of ice was in two times lower than at the bottom ice layer. The maximum value of biomass (4 mg/l) was found at the lower layer of ice on the near shore station in April.

AB  - Abstract
On-going permafrost thaw in discontinuous permafrost regions produces significant amounts of small permafrost subsidence and depressions, while large lakes are likely to drain into streams and rivers. The intensification of permafrost thaw may alter the size distribution and chemical composition of organo-Fe–Al colloids in lakes and rivers. We used a continuum of surface water bodies, from permafrost subsidence, small depressions and thaw ponds to large lakes and rivers that drain the Western Siberia Lowland (WSL), to assess OC, major and the trace element size distribution between the 20-μm, 5-μm, 1.2-μm, 0.45-μm, 0.22-μm, 0.025-μm and 1-kDa (∼1.4 nm) size fractions. This approach allowed us to distinguish the organic and organo-ferric colloids that were responsible for the transport of trace elements in surface waters and address their evolution during possible physico-chemical and biological processes. Both conventionally dissolved (&lt;0.22 μm) and low-molecular-weight (&lt;1 kDa) fractions exhibited an order of magnitude decrease in DOC/Fe in the landscape continuum “depressions and permafrost subsidence → thaw ponds → thermokarst lakes → streams → rivers”. Thermodynamic modeling and on-site size separation suggested that a number of trace elements (TEs), including alkaline earth elements and several micronutrients (Zn, Ba, Mn, and Ni), decreased the degree of their binding to DOM along the landscape continuum, whereas the majority of insoluble TEs (Al, Fe, Co, Cd, Cu, Pb, REEs, Th, and U) remained complexed with DOM in the LMW&lt;1 kDa fraction. Two primary sites of colloid generation included (i) ground vegetation and peat leaching, which supplied DOM complexes of divalent metals and organo-Al entities to thaw ponds and lakes; and (ii) Fe2+ oxidation and TE co-precipitation with Fe hydroxides in the presence of surface DOM at groundwater discharge sites within the riparian/hyporheic zones of rivers. Under a warming climate scenario, an increase in the thickness of the thawing depth will intensify the input of inorganic components from deep mineral horizons and possibly underground waters thus producing the enrichment of large lakes in Fe-rich colloids and particles. The speciation of divalent metal micronutrients (Cu, Ni, and Co) and toxic metals (Al, Cd, Pb, and U) that are complexed within DOM will most likely remain conservative. Overall, the WSL’s surface water colloidal composition may shift from DOM-rich and DOM-Al-rich to Fe-rich, and the export of low-soluble trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates from the soil to rivers will increase.

AB  - Abstract
Precise analysis of the diffusion characteristics of helium in fluorite is crucial for establishing the new fluorite (U–Th–Sm)/He thermochronometer (FHe), which potentially provides a powerful tool for dating ore deposits unsuitable for the application of conventional geochronometers. Incremental helium outgassing experiments performed on fluorites derived from a spectrum of geological environments suggest a thermally activated volume diffusion mechanism. The diffusion behaviour is highly variable and the parameters range between log D0/a2 = 0.30 ± 0.27–7.27 ± 0.46 s−1 and Ea = 96 ± 3.5–182 ± 3.8 kJ/mol. Despite the fact that the CaF2 content of natural fluorites in most cases exceeds 99 weight percent, the closure temperature (Tc) of the fluorite (U–Th–Sm)/He thermochronometer as calculated from these diffusion parameters varies between 46 ± 14 °C and 169 ± 9 °C, considering a 125 μm fragment size. Here we establish that minor substitutions of calcium by rare earth elements and yttrium (REE + Y) and related charge compensation by sodium, fluorine, oxygen and/or vacancies in the fluorite crystal lattice have a significant impact on the diffusivity of helium in the mineral. With increasing REE + Y concentrations F vacancies are reduced and key diffusion pathways are narrowed. Consequently, a higher closure temperature is to be expected. An empirical case study confirms this variability: two fluorite samples from the same deposit (Horni Krupka, Czech Republic) with ca. 170 °C and ca. 43 °C Tc yield highly different (U–Th–Sm)/He ages of 290 ± 10 Ma and 79 ± 10 Ma, respectively. Accordingly, the fluorite sample with the high Tc could have quantitatively retained helium since the formation of the fluorite-bearing ores in the Permian, despite subsequent Mesozoic burial and associated regional hydrothermal heating. In contrast, the fluorite with the low Tc yields a Late Cretaceous age close to the apatite fission track (AFT) and apatite (U–Th)/He ages (AHe) from the same locality. Remarkably, thermal modelling of FHe yields comparable results to the well-established modelling based on AFT and AHe.

Understanding the preservation and deposition history of organic molecules is crucial for the understanding of paleoenvironmental information contained in their abundance ratios such as Uk′37 and TEX86 used as proxies for sea surface temperature (SST). Based on their relatively high refractivity, alkenones and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) can survive postdepositional processes like lateral transport, potentially causing inferred SSTs to be misleading. Likewise, selective preservation of alkenones and GDGTs may cause biases of the SST proxies themselves and can lead to decoupling of both proxy records. Here we report compound-specific radiocarbon data of marine biomarkers including alkenones, GDGTs, and low molecular weight (LMW) n-fatty acids from Black Sea sediments deposited under different redox regimes to evaluate the potentially differential preservation of both biomarker classes and its effect on the SST indices Uk′37 and TEX86. The decadal Δ14C values of alkenones, GDGTs, and LMW n-fatty acids indicate similar preservation under oxic, suboxic, and anoxic redox regimes and no contribution of pre-aged compounds, e.g., by lateral supply. Moreover, similar 14C concentrations of crenarchaeol, alkenones, and LMW n-fatty acids imply that the thaumarchaeotal GDGTs preserved in these sediments are produced in the euphotic zone rather than in subsurface/thermocline waters. However, we observe biomarker-based SSTs that strongly deviate (ΔSST up to 8.4 °C) from in situ measured mean annual SSTs in the Black Sea. This is not due to redox-dependent differential biomarker preservation as implied by their Δ14C values and spatial SST pattern. Since contributions from different sources can largely be excluded, the deviation of the Uk′37 and TEX86 proxy-derived SSTs from in situ SSTs requires further study of phylogenetic and other yet unknown environmental controls on alkenone and GDGT lipid distributions in the Black Sea.

AB  - Abstract
Site-specific isotope ratio measurements potentially provide valuable information about the formation and degradation of complex molecules—information that is lost in conventional bulk isotopic measurements. Here we discuss the background and possible applications of such measurements, and present a technique for studying the site-specific carbon isotope composition of propane at natural abundance based on mass spectrometric analysis of the intact propane molecule and its fragment ions. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach through measurements of mixtures of natural propane and propane synthesized with site-specific 13C enrichment, and we document the limits of precision of our technique. We show that mass balance calculations of the bulk δ13C of propane based on our site-specific measurements is generally consistent with independent constraints on bulk δ13C. We further demonstrate the accuracy of the technique, and illustrate one of its simpler applications by documenting the site-specific carbon isotope signature associated with gas phase diffusion of propane, confirming that our measurements conform to the predictions of the kinetic theory of gases. This method can be applied to propane samples of moderate size (tens of micromoles) isolated from natural gases. Thus, it provides a means of studying the site-specific stable isotope systematics of propane at natural isotope abundances on sample sizes that are readily recovered from many natural environments. This method may also serve as a model for future techniques that apply high-resolution mass spectrometry to study the site-specific isotopic distributions of larger organic molecules, with potential applications to biosynthesis, forensics and other geochemical subjects.

AB  - Abstract
The sulfur isotopic fractionation associated with the formation of organic sulfur compounds (OSCs) during thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) was studied using gold-tube pyrolysis experiments to simulate TSR. The reactants used included n-hexadecane (n-C16) as a model organic compound with sulfate, sulfite, or elemental sulfur as the sulfur source. At the end of each experiment, the S-isotopic composition and concentration of remaining sulfate, H2S, benzothiophene, dibenzothiophene, and 2-phenylthiophene (PT) were measured. The observed S-isotopic fractionations between sulfate and BT, DBT, and H2S in experimental simulations of TSR correlate well with a multi-stage model of the overall TSR process. Large kinetic isotope fractionations occur during the first, uncatalyzed stage of TSR, 12.4‰ for H2S and as much as 22.2‰ for BT. The fractionations decrease as the H2S concentration increases and the reaction enters the second, catalyzed stage. Once all of the oxidizable hydrocarbons have been consumed, sulfate reduction ceases and equilibrium partitioning then dictates the fractionation between H2S and sulfate (∼17‰).

Experiments involving sparingly soluble CaSO4 show that during the second catalytic phase of TSR the rate of sulfate reduction exceeds that of sulfate dissolution. In this case, there is no apparent isotopic fractionation between source sulfate and generated H2S, as all of the available sulfate is effectively reduced at all reaction times. When CaSO4 is replaced with fully soluble Na2SO4, sulfate dissolution is no longer rate limiting and significant S-isotopic fractionation is observed. This supports the notion that CaSO4 dissolution can lead to the apparent lack of fractionation between H2S and sulfate produced by TSR in nature. The S-isotopic composition of individual OSCs record information related to geochemical reactions that cannot be discerned from the δ34S values obtained from bulk phases such as H2S, oil, and sulfate minerals, and provide important mechanistic details about the overall TSR process.

AB  - Abstract
This study presents stable Mg isotopic data for Cenozoic potassic basalts from Wudalianchi and Erkeshan in northeastern China to determine the interactions between upwelling carbonated asthenosphere and enriched lithospheric mantle. Although the Wudalianchi and Erkeshan basalts have variable MgO contents of 4.45 to 9.47 wt.%, they exhibit a homogeneous Mg isotopic composition with δ26Mg values ranging from −0.57‰ to −0.46‰ and averaging −0.51 ± 0.06‰ (2SD, n = 18). This Mg isotopic composition is lighter than that of the average mantle (δ26Mg = −0.25 ± 0.07‰) but similar to late Cretaceous (&lt;110 Ma) and Cenozoic basalts from the North China Craton and the South China Block (δ26Mg = −0.60 to −0.35‰). The high CaO/Al2O3 and Ba/Rb, and low Hf/Hf∗ ratios of the Wudalianchi and Erkeshan basalts are typical characteristics of carbonatitic metasomatism, suggesting that the light Mg isotopic composition could derive from involvement of recycled sedimentary carbonates in the mantle source. The high Dy/Er ratios (2.55 to 2.75) and excess of 230Th (230Th/238U = 1.24 to 1.33) suggest presence of garnet in a relatively deep mantle source. Additionally, the seismic tomographic observations show the existence of the stagnant Pacific slab in the mantle transition zone (410–660 km) under eastern China. This carbonated mantle source should be located in the asthenosphere. However, compared to other low δ26Mg basalts from eastern China with MORB-like Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic compositions and OIB-like trace element features, the Wudalianchi and Erkeshan basalts exhibit EM-I Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic compositions combined with high SiO2, Ba, K, Pb and LREE contents, high Ba/Th and low Ce/Pb ratios. These geochemical features require a contribution from another mantle source, most likely an EM-I lithospheric mantle. Therefore, an asthenosphere-lithosphere interaction model is proposed for determine the origin of the Wudalianchi and Erkeshan basalts. The original melt was derived from partial melting of the carbonated asthenospheric mantle that was metasomatized by carbonate melt from the stagnant Pacific slab in the mantle transition zone. This ascending melt with a low δ26Mg signature subsequently interacted with the EM-I lithospheric mantle. The interaction dissolved pyroxene and crystallized olivine, releasing LILE, REE, Sr and Pb from dissolved minerals into the melt. Simultaneously, Mg was inherited by newly formed olivine. Therefore, this interaction modified the trace elements and the Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic compositions of the melt toward EM-I geochemical features but preserved the light Mg isotope signatures.

AB  - Abstract
Thermoluminescence (TL) properties of 29 CO chondrites from the Miller Range (MIL) and five chondrites from the Dominion Range (DOM) have been measured. MIL has a relatively strong natural TL signal (19.6 ± 14.7 krad), while some of the DOM samples have a very weak natural TL signal (&lt;1 krad) whereas others resemble the MIL meteorites. I argue that MIL and some of the DOM samples had a normal perihelion (∼1.0 AU) and terrestrial age of ∼450–700 ka, while some of the DOM samples have a terrestrial age of ∼100 ka but a perihelion of ∼0.8 AU. The DOM meteorites also show considerable heterogeneity in their induced TL properties, also suggesting that the DOM fragments represent more than one fall. The induced TL data for the MIL samples studied here are consistent with them all being from a single fragmented meteorite. Small (50 mg) chips have TL properties similar to 500 mg chips, so that the smaller chips are representative, although samples taken from original masses less than ∼2 g have low natural TL suggesting that they were heated during atmospheric fall. The properties of CO chondrites are reviewed in terms of their petrologic types. Correlations between TL sensitivity, the most quantitative technique for evaluating metamorphic alteration in CO chondrites, and data for olivine composition and heterogeneity, matrix composition, inert gas content, metal composition (Ni, Co, and Cr in the kamacite), bulk carbon, C and O isotopes, graphite ordering, spectral reflectance at 0.8 μm, and textural characteristics of the ameboid olivine and Ca-rich inclusions are examined. The petrographic types appear to be largely metamorphic in origin with perhaps a minor role for metasomatism. Contrary to recent proposals it is here argued that petrologic type definitions should (1) be specific enough to be meaningful, but broad enough to be simple in application and robust to new developments, (2) be descriptive and not interpretative, (3) should not oversimplify and obscure important class-to-class differences, and (4) take account of all the available information, while avoiding reliance on any one technique or single observation whose application is based on interpretation. With these considerations in mind the petrographic type definitions for CO chondrites are restated and the petrologic type of 3.2 assigned to both the MIL and DOM CO chondrites.

AB  - Abstract
Dark brown sediment layers are a potential stratigraphic tool in Quaternary Arctic Ocean sediments. They are rich in Mn, Fe, and trace metals scavenged from the water column and were most likely deposited during interglacial intervals. In this study, we combine sediment and pore water data from sediment cores taken in different parts of the Arctic Ocean to investigate the influence of early diagenetic processes on sediment geochemistry. In most studied cores, Mn, Co, and Mo are released into the pore waters from Mn oxide dissolution in deeper (&gt;1.5 m) sediment layers. The relationship between sedimentary Mn, Co, and Mo contents in excess of the lithogenic background (elementxs) shows that Coxs/Moxs values are a diagnostic tool to distinguish between layers with diagenetic metal addition from the pore waters (Coxs/Moxs &lt; 1), layers affected by Mn oxide dissolution and metal release (Coxs/Moxs &gt; 10), and unaffected layers (Coxs/Moxs from 1 to 10). Steady-state calculations based on current pore water profiles reveal that in the studied cores, the diagenetic addition of these metals from the pore water pool alone is not sufficient to produce the sedimentary metal enrichments. However, it seems evident that dissolution of Mn oxides in the Mn reduction zone can permanently alter the primary geochemical signature of the dark brown layers. Therefore, pore water data and Coxs/Moxs values should be considered before core correlation when this correlation is solely based on Mn contents and dark sediment color. In contrast to the mostly non-lithogenic origin of Mn in the dark brown layers, sedimentary Fe consists of a large lithogenic (80%) and a small non-lithogenic fraction (20%). Our pore water data show that diagenetic Fe remobilization is not currently occurring in the sediment. The dominant Fe sources are coastal erosion and river input. Budget calculations show that Fe seems to be trapped in the modern Arctic Ocean and accumulates in shelf and basin sediments.

The Fe isotopic signal δ56Fe of the solid phase is positive (∼0.2–0.3‰) in samples defined as the lithogenic background without significant Fe enrichments. With increasing non-lithogenic Fe contents in the sediment, δ56Fe becomes more negative, which indicates a shelf-to-basin export of an isotopically lighter Fe fraction. We assume that the same transport process is true for Mn.

AB  - Abstract
This study aims to evaluate the role of micro-organisms and their siderophores in the first steps of the alteration processes of basaltic glasses in aqueous media. In this regard, three different types of glasses – with or without iron, in the reduced Fe(II) or oxidized Fe(III) states – were prepared on the basis of a simplified basaltic glass composition. Control and Pseudomonas aeruginosa inoculated experiments were performed in a buffered (pH 6.5) nutrient depleted medium to stimulate the production of the pyoverdine siderophore. Results show that the presence of P. aeruginosa has an effect on the dissolution kinetics of all glasses as most of the calculated elemental release rates are increased compared to sterile conditions. Reciprocally, the composition of the glass in contact with P. aeruginosa has an impact on the bacterial growth and siderophore production. As an essential nutrient for this microbial strain, Fe notably appears to play a central role during biotic experiments. Its presence in the glass stimulates the bacterial growth and minimizes the synthesis of pyoverdine. Moreover the initial Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio in the glasses modulates this synthesis, as pyoverdine is not detected at all in the system in contact with Fe(III)-bearing glass. Finally, the dissolution rates appear to be correlated to siderophore concentrations as they increase with respect to sterile experiments in the order Fe(III)-bearing glass &lt; Fe(II)-bearing glass &lt; Fe-free glass. This increase is attributed to complexation reactions between siderophores and Fe or Al for Fe(II)-bearing glass or Fe-free glass, respectively. The dissolution of an Fe-free glass is significantly improved in the presence of bacteria, as initial dissolution rates are increased by a factor of 3. This study attests to the essential role of siderophores in the P. aeruginosa-promoted dissolution processes of basaltic glasses as well as to the complex relationships between the nutritional potential of the glass and its dissolution rates.

AB  - Abstract
Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and there are concerns that its natural emissions from the Arctic could act as a substantial positive feedback to anthropogenic global warming. Determining the sources of methane emissions and the biogeochemical processes controlling them is important for understanding present and future Arctic contributions to atmospheric methane budgets. Here we apply measurements of multiply-substituted isotopologues, or clumped isotopes, of methane as a new tool to identify the origins of ebullitive fluxes in Alaska, Sweden and the Arctic Ocean. When methane forms in isotopic equilibrium, clumped isotope measurements indicate the formation temperature. In some microbial methane, however, non-equilibrium isotope effects, probably related to the kinetics of methanogenesis, lead to low clumped isotope values. We identify four categories of emissions in the studied samples: thermogenic methane, deep subsurface or marine microbial methane formed in isotopic equilibrium, freshwater microbial methane with non-equilibrium clumped isotope values, and mixtures of deep and shallow methane (i.e., combinations of the first three end members). Mixing between deep and shallow methane sources produces a non-linear variation in clumped isotope values with mixing proportion that provides new constraints for the formation environment of the mixing end-members. Analyses of microbial methane emitted from lakes, as well as a methanol-consuming methanogen pure culture, support the hypothesis that non-equilibrium clumped isotope values are controlled, in part, by kinetic isotope effects induced during enzymatic reactions involved in methanogenesis. Our results indicate that these kinetic isotope effects vary widely in microbial methane produced in Arctic lake sediments, with non-equilibrium Δ18 values spanning a range of more than 5‰.

AB  - Described herein is the first version release of monthly temperature holdings of a new Global Land Surface Meteorological Databank. Organized under the auspices of the International Surface Temperature Initiative (ISTI), an international group of scientists have spent three years collating and merging data from numerous sources to create a merged holding. This release in its recommended form consists of over 30 000 individual station records, some of which extend over the past 300 years. This article describes the sources, the chosen merge methodology, and the resulting databank characteristics. Several variants of the databank have also been released that reflect the structural uncertainty in merging datasets. Variants differ in, for example, the order in which sources are considered and the degree of congruence required in station geolocation for consideration as a merged or unique record. Also described is a version control protocol that will be applied in the event of updates. Future updates are envisaged with the addition of new data sources, and with changes in processing, where public feedback is always welcomed. Major updates, when necessary, will always be accompanied by a new journal paper. This databank release forms the foundation for the construction of new global land surface air temperature analyses by the global research community and their assessment by the ISTI's benchmarking and assessment working group.

AB  - Daily observations of weather and climate for the province of Québec, Canada, start in the 18th century and continue to the present day. Daily temperature observations from 12 observers ranging from 1742 to 1873 are described here. The frequency distributions of the temperature observations from each of the historical weather journals are examined for data quality and consistency. Adjustments for differing types of exposures, particularly north wall exposures, are developed. It is shown that examination of the daily data distribution can be used to infer information concerning the instruments used and likely exposure in the absence of metadata. Comparisons of the relative frequency distributions of historical and modern hourly observations are used to assess the reliability of the daily historical temperature data, and are able to detect problems with instrument exposure or sampling biases. Historical observations of temperature from the 18th and 19th centuries are shown to be comparable to modern temperature data. These daily observations will be used in further studies to analyse changes in climate and extreme conditions on a decadal to centennial time frame, and will form part of international data sets for the reconstruction and analysis of past climate events.

AB  - Historical climatic data from station observations taken in North African and Middle East Mediterranean countries since the second half of the 19th century have been digitized and quality-controlled in the framework of the EU-funded European Reanalysis and Observations for Monitoring (EURO4M) project. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation totals, along with sub-daily data for surface air pressure have been recovered by using historical data sources involving book/logbook collections archived in national and international data centres. The new dataset produced comprises climatic time series for 79 stations that have operated in southern and eastern Mediterranean countries. While the developed time series have data gaps, every effort has been made to infill these gaps, to improve assessments of the long-term changes in climate variability in the region.

AB  - The Mars Analysis Correction Data Assimilation (MACDA) dataset version 1.0 contains the reanalysis of fundamental atmospheric and surface variables for the planet Mars covering a period of about three Martian years (a Martian year is about 1.88 terrestrial years). This has been produced by data assimilation of observations from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft during its science mapping phase (February 1999–August 2004). In particular, we have used retrieved thermal profiles and total dust optical depths from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on board MGS. Data have been assimilated into a Mars global climate model (MGCM) using the Analysis Correction scheme developed at the UK Meteorological Office. The MGCM used is the UK spectral version of the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD, Paris, France) MGCM. MACDA is a joint project of the University of Oxford and The Open University in the UK.

AB  - The implementation of a webGIS service platform dedicated to the management and sharing of climatological data acquired by high elevation stations is the core of the Station at High Altitude for Research on the Environment (SHARE) GeoNetwork project, promoted by the Ev-K2 CNR Committee. The web platform basically will provide three types of services: structured metadata archive, data and results from high-altitude environments research and projects; access to high-altitude Ev-K2 CNR stations and creation of a network of existing stations; dedicated webGIS for geo-referenced data collected during the research. High elevation environmental and territorial data and metadata are catalogued in a single integrated platform to get access to the information heritage of the SHARE project, using open-source tools: Geonetwork for the metadata catalogue and webGIS resources, and the open-source Weather and Water Database (WDB), developed by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, for the database information system implementation. The information system is designed to have a main node, with the possibility to install relocated subsystems based on the same technology, named focal point of SHARE, which will contain metadata and data connected to the main node. In this study, a new structure of metadata for the description of the climatological stations is proposed and WDB adaptation and data preprocessing are described in detail, giving code and script samples.

AB  - There is a significant lack of historical climate data in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the northern latitudes. To address this data scarcity and to improve understanding of regional climate variability, historical instrumental observations were recovered for southeastern Australian (SEA) for the 1788–1859 period. Instrumental observations of temperature, atmospheric pressure, rainfall and raindays were rescued from 39 archival sources, and examined to identify observer biases and inhomogeneities. The rescued data provide continuous information on SEA climate variability from 1826 to 1859, with short periods of observations identified between 1788–1791, 1803–1805 and 1821–1824. Quality control and homogenization of each data source indicates that the historical observations successfully capture regional interannual climate variability. The historical records exhibit high correlations between neighbouring observations and related climate variables. The instrumental observations also display very good agreement with documentary climate reconstructions, further verifying their quality. As an example of how this new historical dataset may be used, regional averages of the observations were calculated to estimate interannual climate variability across SEA from 1826 to 1859. Prolonged dry conditions were identified in various parts of the region during 1837–1843 and 1845–1852, while wet conditions were noted from 1836 to 1838, primarily in southern SEA. Anomalously cold periods were also identified in 1835–1836 and 1848–1849, in general agreement with temperature reconstructions from other regions of the Southern Hemisphere. This new dataset provides a valuable source of subdaily to monthly information on SEA climate variability for future climate analysis, palaeoclimate reconstruction verification and historical studies.

AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) datasets have been generated from satellite observations for the period 1991–2010, intended for use in climate science applications. Attributes of the datasets specifically relevant to climate applications are: first, independence from in situ observations; second, effort to ensure homogeneity and stability through the time-series; third, context-specific uncertainty estimates attached to each SST value; and, fourth, provision of estimates of both skin SST (the fundamental measurement, relevant to air-sea fluxes) and SST at standard depth and local time (partly model mediated, enabling comparison with historical in situ datasets). These attributes in part reflect requirements solicited from climate data users prior to and during the project. Datasets consisting of SSTs on satellite swaths are derived from the Along-Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSRs) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRRs). These are then used as sole SST inputs to a daily, spatially complete, analysis SST product, with a latitude-longitude resolution of 0.05°C and good discrimination of ocean surface thermal features. A product user guide is available, linking to reports describing the datasets' algorithmic basis, validation results, format, uncertainty information and experimental use in trial climate applications. Future versions of the datasets will span at least 1982–2015, better addressing the need in many climate applications for stable records of global SST that are at least 30 years in length.

AB  - The ‘Egg Model’ is a synthetic reservoir model consisting of an ensemble of 101 relatively small three-dimensional realizations of a channelized oil reservoir produced under water flooding conditions with eight water injectors and four oil producers. It has been used in numerous publications to demonstrate a variety of aspects related to computer-assisted flooding optimization and history matching. Unfortunately the details of the parameter settings are not always identical and not always fully documented in several of these publications. We present a ‘standard version’ of the Egg Model which is meant to serve as a test case in future publications, and a dataset of 100 permeability realizations in addition to the permeability field used for the standard model. We implemented and tested the model in four reservoir simulators: Dynamo/Mores (Shell), Eclipse (Schlumberger), AD-GPRS (Stanford University) and MRST (Sintef), which produced near-identical output. This article describes the input parameters of the standard model. Together with the input files for the various simulators, it has been be uploaded in the 3TU.Datacentrum repository with free access to external users.
